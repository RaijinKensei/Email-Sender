# Email-Sender

This program allows you to send emails from the command prompt, through Outlook.

Since Google has forbidden the use of third party apps to access,
you have to use Outlook to login but you can send email to anyone, anyway.

TUTORIAL:

-Insert your email and password
-Insert the receiver email, subject and body of the email

Done.
